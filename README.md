# Arbitrum Sports Oracle Agent

An autonomous, self-improving sports betting agent operating on the Arbitrum One network. This project leverages the Superior Agents framework to create a "Darwinian Intelligence" that learns and evolves from real-world profit and loss feedback.

## üèõÔ∏è Core Philosophy

The agent's logic is guided by "Darwinian Intelligence". It is designed not as a static algorithm, but as an evolving system that adapts its strategies based on performance. The primary success metric is wallet profitability, measured in USDC.e.

## üöÄ Architecture Overview

This project is a multi-container Docker application composed of several key services:

* **ü§ñ Agent (`superior-agent-v1`):** The core "brain" of the operation. A Python service that analyzes markets, generates recommendations using an LLM, and prepares on-chain transactions.
* **üì° Dashboard API (`dashboard-api`):** A Flask-based backend that serves data from the agent's database to the frontend.
* **üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Frontend (`dashboard-frontend`):** A modern React application served by Nginx, providing a professional UI for monitoring and manual execution of the agent's recommendations.
* **üß† RAG API (`rag-api`):** A Retrieval-Augmented Generation service that acts as the agent's long-term memory.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Utilizes LLMs to analyze market data, including odds, liquidity, and volume.
* **Professional React Dashboard:** A real-time UI to monitor agent status, wallet balance, P&L, and manage bets.
* **Manual Execution & Control:** Full control over the agent via the dashboard's Control Panel and "Mark as Executed" functionality.
* **Advanced Views:** Includes specialized views for single bets, combo (parlay) bets, and recommendations grouped by analysis cycle.
* **Persistent Operation:** The agent runs on a continuous 8-hour cycle and is configured to restart automatically, ensuring constant market analysis.
* **Secure & Sanitized:** This public version has had all sensitive data (API keys, private keys, logs, reports) removed.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anza21/Arbitrum-Sports-Agent-Showcase.git
    cd Arbitrum-Sports-Agent-Showcase
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file inside the `agent/` directory by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp agent/.env.example agent/.env
    ```
    You will need to fill in the required API keys (Overtime, TheOdds, etc.) and your Arbitrum wallet details (`WALLET_ADDRESS`, `PRIVATE_KEY`).

3.  **Run the System:**
    Navigate to the Docker directory and start all services:
    ```bash
    cd agent/docker
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Dashboard:**
    After a minute or two, the dashboard will be available at **[http://localhost](http://localhost)**.
